/*
    Write a program that stores the word for each digit in an array.
    The program should ask the user to enter a number between 0 and 9 and
    should display the corresponding word. For example, if the user enters 4,
    the program should display "four." Use a switch statement to determine the
    word to display from the array. If the number is not between 0 and 9, the program should 
    display "Not a valid digit and exit. 

    Optimization: Can you get the same result without using a switch statement?
